# Who, what, where, when and why

## Who is this for?
This is for Non-Profits like School PTO's who want to automate their membership entry.  

The skill level for the end users is spread sheet data entry with no coding experience.  Maintaining a website most likely will be beyond the user's abilities.  

## What
Google scripts for Google Form generation and public and private membership information.  Plus information on how a non-profit can obtain a G-Suites account for Free.

## Why
Nonprofits spend their time manually entering membership information into spread sheets.  Google Forms and Sheets can be used to automate this task.  

To Do:

* Develop instructions on how to use a set of Google scripts that will auto generate a public and private membership directory as Google sheets.  The public directory will sort the private directory by the child's grade as separate sheets.

* Develop instructions on how to use google Scripts to generate a form

* Develop instructions on how to link membership payment system (PayPal)

* Develop instructions on how a non-profit can set up a G-Suites for non-profits.

* Finish creating the Google scripts.

## Done
* Google Form Generator from Spread sheet
** Emails recipients their inputs
* Email Google Link to those who paid.

## Google Scripts
Google Scripts are Java(esq)scripts that can be run within the Google Sheet.  You can create custom drop down menus with google scripts.

## How Set are you with Google Scripts
Went down the Google script route since I am using the G-Suite products: Sheets, Sites and Forms.  There are limitations with going down this route.  I am not a web developer.  
Which explains why I did not go down the creation of a website.  But I am open to hear ideals.
